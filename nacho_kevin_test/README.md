# Simple Shell Test

This is a test for the shell project of Holberton School

## Usage:
In order to test this script, you'll first need to clone this repository: 
````
git clone https://github.com/Nachop51/shell_tests.git
````
Then copy the test file to your project dir:
````
cp /nacho_kevin/test ../your_shell
````
Compile your shell with all this flags:
````
gcc -g -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh
````
Then execute your shell with valgrind and then do this:
````
/bin/sh tests.sh
````
And then check if the expected output is the same as your output!

Thanks for using!
